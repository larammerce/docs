## Template engine basics

[[toc]]

In this tutorial, the basics of the Larammerce Template Engine will be explained. As you know, Larammerce is based on Laravel, and if you check a Larammerce template, you see that Larammerce blade files are the same as Laravel blade files. On the previous page, you learned about the templating system in a nutshell, so if you wanna know more about the system and dive deeper, please continue reading this page and other listed documents in the templating system index.

This document covers the rules and main development concepts of the templating system in Larammerce.

`.blade.php` files are in the following directory `public/views/example.blade.php`.

There are three types of blade files in the template engine as shown below:

```
|---views/
    |---_base.blade.php
    |---_cart-no-active-modal.blade.php
    |---_comparison_item.blade.php
    |---_customers.blade.php
```

```
|---views/
    |---about.blade.php
    |---address-add.blade.php
    |---address-edit.blade.php
    |---auth-email-check.blade.php
```

1- File name starts with underscore (partial files)

2- File name does not start with underscore

NOTE: A partial blade file is a part of a template view that is reusable but can not be used directory, These partial files are the same as partial files in the SCSS lang. It's an easy way to make a part of a template reusable and make the debug process faster.

For example, Using the following piece of code tells the blade template engine to use the **\_base.blade.php** file as the current page's layout.

```php
@extends('_base') # Write this code in the about.blade.php file.
```

And to use the **\_meta_tags.blade.php** page on other pages using the following code:

```php
@section('meta_tags')
    @include('_meta_tags', ['obj' => $web_page])
    <meta property="og:type" content="website">
@endsection # Write this code in the index.blade.php file.
```

So to create a layout that extends to all pages, put an underscore at the beginning of the page's name.

3- The end of the file name is **\_mobile** or **\_app**.

```
|---views/
    |---index_mobile.blade.php
    |---index.blade.php
```

As you know, responsive web design works through CSS, using various settings to different style properties depending on the screen size of the userâ€™s device. Sometimes the design structure of pages on mobile and desktop is different, so create a file with the **\_mobile** extension to be displayed on mobile pages with this structure. And for mobile applications, the system provides **\_app** pages.

Blade pages are reviewed below.

## Required blade files

Some files are needed by the system and you have to place them in your project, As below:

**Adress page, Auth page, Blog page, Cart page, Error page, Invoice page, Mail page, Order page, Profile page, Sms page, Product page**.

And other files are not necessary and you can add them on demand in the template, As below:
**About page, Buy guide page, Contact page, Faq page, Index page, Privacy page, Register page, Rules page, Shipping page, Privacy page, Support page, Wish list page, Unreachable page**.

## Address page

```
|---views/
    |---address-add.blade.php
    |---address-edit.blade.php
    |---address-add.blade.php
    |---address-edit.blade.php
```

In these pages, there is a form with post method and inputs: state_id, city_id, superscription, phone_number, zipcode, transferee_name. And be sure to add **csrf_field** inside the form.

These inputs are required and if one of the inputs is not filled, there is an error when sending to the **customer.address.store** rout. Form information should not be changed if the form design is changed.

## Auth page

```
|---views/
    |---auth-email-check.blade.php
    |---auth-email-register.blade.php
    |---auth-email-show.blade.php
    |---auth-mobile-check.blade.php
    |---auth-mobile-password.blade.php
    |---auth-mobile-register.blade.php
    |---auth-mobile-show.blade.php
```

To authenticate in the system:

First, enter the phone number or email in the **auth-mobile-show.blade.php** or **auth-email-show.blade.php** page.

If a member of the system and the password is set, the **auth-mobile-password.blade.php** page is displayed. And if the password is not set, entering the one-time code in the **auth-mobile-check.blade.php** or **auth-email-check.blade.php** page.

If not a member of the system, entering the one-time code in the **auth-mobile-check.blade.php** or **auth-email-check.blade.php** page. and enter the **auth-email-register.blade.php** or **auth-mobile-register.blade.php** page.

Let's check the authentication files:

1- **auth-mobile-show.blade.php**

In this page, there is an input with **type ="mobile"** and **name ="mobile"** that this email will be sent to the backend with the **customer-auth.do-mobile-auth** route.

2- **auth-mobile-check.blade.php**

There is an input, enter the one-time code to send to the server.

3- **auth-mobile-password.blade.php**

4- **auth-mobile-register.blade.php**

In this page, there is a form with post method and inputs: name, family, email, phone, main_phone, national_code. And be sure to add csrf_field inside the form.

These pages must be created and the inputs inside the pages are mandatory and should not be changed. Only the design of the pages can be changed.If there are changes in the structure of ecommerce, it will be announced in the documents of the next version.
