### Display product properties

The complete directory structure of the template for this project is shown below. The template directory has two subdirectories, **public**, and **resources**, which are the Boilerplate of this project. For more information on creating a layout and its steps, see [5 minute quick start](https://docs.larammerce.com/8.x/theme-development/).

```bash
|---node_modules/
|---public/
     |---HCMS-assets/
     |---views/
|---resources/
     |---assets/
          |---css
          |---js
          |---sass
|---.envrc
|---.envrc.example
|---.gitignore
|---composer.json
|---deploy.sh
|---mix-manifest.json
|---package.json
|---package-lock.json
|---webpack.mix.js
```

**TIP:** _Boilerplate is any text, documentation, or procedures that can be reused more than once in a new context without any substantial changes to the original._ _<sup>[1](#1)</sup>_

**TIP:** _The blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine that is included with Laravel._ _<sup>[2](#2)</sup>_

Presently if you enter the product's single page, **how can you show the item properties?**
Larammerce will tell you.

if you click on a product in the store, you will enter a single page with a dedicated URL that displays content from the blade called `product-single.blade.php`. The procedure, in general, is as which if you enter the `product-single.blade.php` file in the `public/views` path of the template, you can display the properties on the single product page by calling the properties.

**NOTE:** The `product-single.blade.php` and `product-single_mobile.blade.php` pages are for displaying single product pages.

**NOTE:** If you go to the `product-single.blade.php` file, you will notice that the file's `@extends (_'base')` was used first, which is because the site's headers and footers pages are similar, and it is not necessary to create a template for this page.

For example, You delete the entire content of the page and write the following command in the terminal:

##### EXAMPLE

```bash
./deploy.sh #to deploy the resources to the backend directory
```

Write the following code snippet:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

And write again in the terminal:

##### EXAMPLE

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Finally, enter the browser and after refreshing, you will see that the changes have been applied and you will see the phrase "Hello World".

Presently that you simply know how it works, the Larammerce group will center on the most theme of this area, which is the show of properties.
So, let's take some steps:

**NOTE:** When you work on the `product-single.blade.php` file, the backend panel gives you a variable called `$product`. You can use it to view fields and product properties.

##### SOURCE

```php
@php
   dd($product); #view fields and product properties
@endphp
```

**TIP:** _As you know, you can also use blade tags._ _<sup>[2](#2)</sup>_

**TIP:** _Blade's {{ }} echo statements are automatically sent through PHP's `htmlspecialchars` function to prevent XSS attacks._ _<sup>[2](#2)</sup>_

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Finally, go to the browser and refresh, you will see a product model and if you open the attributes field all the properties will be available to you. If you are not sure what properties to use, you can use this method.

Now, you can display the product **title**, **product code**, **latest price**, **previous price**, and **count**:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<h1>{{$product->title}}</h1> #Displays the title field
<div>
   <ul>
      <li>Product code: {{$product->code}}</li> #Display product code
      <li>Previous price: {{$product->previous_price}} Toman</li> #Displays the previous price
      <li>Product price: {{$product->latest_price}} Toman</li> #Displays the latest price
      <li>Count: {{$product->count}} Number</li> #Displays the Number
   </ul>
</div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

When you go to your browser and refresh the page, you can see the product title, previous price, last price, and number.

You can also check if the product has a **discount plan** or not:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<h1>{{$product->title}}</h1>
<div>
   <ul>
      <li>Product code: {{$product->code}}</li>
      @if($product->has_discount) #Examines the discount plan
        <li>previous price: {{$product->previous_price}} Toman</li>
      @endif
      <li>product price: {{$product->latest_price}} Toman</li>
      <li>count: {{$product->count}} Number</li>
   </ul>
</div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

You can specify **product categories**:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<div>
      <h4>Here you can see that what parent directories there are:</h4>
   <ul>
      @foreach($product->directory->getParentDirectories() as $parent_directory)
         <li>{{$parent_directory->title}}</li> #Displays parent directories
      @endforeach
        <li>{{$product->title}}</li> #Product title
   </ul>
</div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**In the example above**, `getParentDirectories()` in `foreach`, which is part of the `directory`, is considered as `$parent_directory`.
Finally, you asked the `foreach` to print the title of each `$parent_directory`.

You can also show **images** of your product:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<div>
   <h4>Here you can see what product image there are:</h4>
   <ul>
      @foreach($product->images as $index=>$product_image)
         <li>
            <img src="{{url(ImageService::getImage($product_image, 'preview'))}}" alt="The image number {{$index}}"> #View product image
         </li>
      @endforeach
   </ul>
</div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**In the example above**, `$product->images` in `foreach`, is considered as `$index=>$product_image`.
Finally, you asked the `foreach` to print the title of each `$parent_directory`.

**NOTE:** The `img` tag is used to print the image, which contains the `src` and `alt` attributes.
Note that in `src` you must use a service called `ImageService`, ImageService is defined in the backend of the site, so that you can give it an input and ask it to give you an image.

##### SOURCE

```php
url(ImageService::getImage($product_image, 'preview'))
```

**NOTE:** You can also have different sizes of product images such as previews or full, for this purpose, You can refer to `config/cms/images.php` to find out what sizes are for the product image.

##### SOURCE

```php
    "product" => [
        "ratio" => "1/1",
        "thumb" => ["width" => 350, "height" => 350],
        "preview" => ["width" => 700, "height" => 700],
        "original" => ["width" => 2000, "height" => 2000],
    ],
```

##### EXAMPLE

```php
url(ImageService::getImage($product_image, 'thumb'))
```

**NOTE:** In Laravel, the relationships between objects, if you want to get the list of properties, **just write the name of the relationship**, Otherwise, if you want to create a new query on a relationship, use the "**()**" symbol and then write your query.

##### EXAMPLE

```php
$obj->relationships; #this returns a list of object related to specific object.
$obj->relationships()->someExtraQuery()->get(); #this relationships() method returns a QueryBuilder object which helps the developer to create more complicated queries.
```

Well, you can also put a **description** for the product, which is as follows:

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use the open and closed tags of Laravel "**!!**" use for the description.

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<div>
   <p>{!! $product->description !!}</p> #Show product description
</div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Each product mold contains a set of attributes, for example, valves is a product whose attributes can include brand, size, and body material. To display the **attributes** of a product such as brand and body material, you can proceed as follows:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<div>
   <hr>
      <ul>
         @foreach($attributes as $key_id => $attribute)
            <li>
               <span>{{$attribute->title}}</span> #Attribute title, body Material
               <span>:</span>
               @foreach($attribute->values as $val_index => $value)
                  <span>{{$value->name}}</span>, #Attribute name, such as Cast iron metal
               @endforeach
            </li>
         @endforeach
      </ul>
   <hr>
<div>
```

And write in the terminal:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Below you can see the full example:

##### EXAMPLE

```php
<h1>{{$product->title}}</h1>
<div>
   <ul>
      <li>Product code: {{$product->code}}</li> #Display product code
      @if($product->has_discount) #Examines the discount plan
        <li>previous price: {{$product->previous_price}} Toman</li>
      @endif
      <li>product price: {{$product->latest_price}} Toman</li> #Displays the latest price
      <li>count: {{$product->count}} Number</li> #Displays the Number
   </ul>
      <h4>Here you can see that what parent directories there are:</h4>
   <ul>
      @foreach($product->directory->getParentDirectories() as $parent_directory)
         <li>{{$parent_directory->title}}</li> #Displays parent directories
      @endforeach
        <li>{{$product->title}}</li> #Product title
   </ul>
      <h4>Here you can see what product image there are:</h4>
   <ul>
      @foreach($product->images as $index=>$product_image)
         <li>
            <img src="{{url(ImageService::getImage($product_image, 'preview'))}}" alt="The image number {{$index}}"> #View product image
         </li>
      @endforeach
   </ul>
   <hr>
      <ul>
         @foreach($attributes as $key_id => $attribute)
            <li>
               <span>{{$attribute->title}}</span> #Attribute title, body Material
               <span>:</span>
               @foreach($attribute->values as $val_index => $value)
                  <span>{{$value->name}}</span>, #Attribute name, such as Cast iron metal
               @endforeach
            </li>
         @endforeach
      </ul>
   <hr>
      <p>{!! $product->description !!}</p>
</div>
```

With the help of the following command in the terminal, you can return the code state to the default theme and see the following example in the default theme:

```bash
git checkout -- public/views/product-single.blade.php
./deploy.sh
```

**NOTE:** It is important to mention that you are absolutely free to manage and design any of the template pages using Larammerce methods and helpers. So please feel free to make your pages and be aware of the page naming.
