## :rocket: 5 minute quick start
Larammerce is using the Laravel framework as its core system and obviously inherits all Laravel features. for example, Larammerce uses Blade (Laravelâ€™s templating engine), to easily create a standard page template, or layout.

The complete directory structure of the template for this project is shown below.

```
|---node_modules/
|---public/
     |---HCMS-assets/
     |---views/
|---resources/
     |---assets/
          |---css
          |---js
          |---sass
|---.envrc
|---.envrc.example
|---.gitignore
|---composer.json
|---deploy.sh
|---mix-manifest.json
|---package.json
|---package-lock.json
|---webpack.mix.js
```
The template directory has two subdirectories, **public** and **resources**, which are the Boilerplate of this project.
>a boilerplate is a unit of writing that can be reused over and over without change.

In the **public** directory, there are two subdirectories, **HCMS-assets** and **views**. and `./deploy.sh` command to deploy the **HCMS-assets** and **views** directories to the backend directory.
```
|---public/
     |---HCMS-assets/
     |---views/
```
And in the **resources** directory there are sass, css, and js files.
```
|--->resources/
     |---assets/
          |---css
          |---js
          |---sass
```


## Create layouts in a few steps.
As you know Larammerce is based on the Laravel framework and creates a layout using the  Blade template engine.

So, let's follow a few steps to create layouts:
 
First, create the following file `public/views/5-minute.blade.php`

Put the following in the file:
```html
<h1> Hello World! </h1>
```
Then to build the project resource file run:
```bash
npm run watch # to watch for resource file changes and then build and export them after every change.
```
And enter this command to deploy the resources to the backend directory:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
Open the admin panel in the browser and in the list of directories:

Click the Plus button ![Plus button](/plus-button.png), then create a new folder ![Plus button](/new-folder.png).

The new folder settings are as follows:

 ![Plus button](/add-new-folder.png)

Enter a **title** and **url section** for this page .
>title: 5 minute quick start 

>url section: min-5
 
Activate the **Show in menu button** and **Show in mobile app button** to display this page in the menu and application, then activate the **Web page button** to connect the blade page.

Finally, click the **Edit webpage button** and select the blade page.

After all you can check to the URL of your web page in a browser and see the page is created with the desired contents:
>https://localhot:8080/min-5
