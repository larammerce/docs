## Directories

[[toc]]

As the essential part, Directories are the system's main body; they represent the structure of dynamic routes and hold the content of related web pages so that everything shown in the e-commerce is a part of one or more directories or placed underneath one.

Directory is a Laravel model that extends Eloquent BaseModel to manage the content of directories existing in the system. Let's take a shallow look at the properties and relationships of the Directory class.

### Show directory properties

`$directory` and `$web_page` variable is passed from the controller to the blade, and the content of the directory can be displayed using this variables.

**NOTE:** If you are considering to show the SEO contents in the web pages, It's important to know that `seo_keywords` and `seo_description` of each web page is stored in the `$web_page` variable. So that if you want to get desired data use `$directory->webPage` or `$web_page` directly.

#### getParentDirectories()

---

This function returns a list of parents to which the current directory belongs. Also, please note that the result list also consists of the current directory.

```php
@foreach($directory->getParentDirectories() as $parentDirectory)
   <li>
      <a href="{{directory_url($parentDirectory)."/?landing=true"}}"
         title="{{$parentDirectory->title}}">{{$parentDirectory->title}}
      </a>
   </li>
@endforeach
```

Below you can see three SEO-related functions that are obtained using the `$web_page` object:
