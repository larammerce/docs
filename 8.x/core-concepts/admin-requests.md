## Admin Requests

[[toc]]

This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the admin request functionality, covering everything from its inner workings to how you can make modifications to it. You can study about the
[Request lifecycle in Laravel](#request-lifecycle-in-laravel) and the
[Request lifecycle in Larammerce](#request-lifecycle-in-larammerce) in this
article if you are interested.

## The usage of admin request functions

Let's explore how these functions are used.

Path to the `/Larammerce/routes/web.php` and create these routes within the file:

```php
Route::get("/start", function(){

    echo ("Hi, This is /start \n <br/>");

    echo \App\Utils\CMS\AdminRequestService::isInAdminArea()?
    "We are in admin area" : "We are out of admin area";

});

Route::get("/admin/start ",function(){

    echo ("Hi, This is /admin/start \n <br/>");

    echo \App\Utils\CMS\AdminRequestService::isInAdminArea()?
    "We are in admin area" : "We are out of admin area"

});

```

To view the output, navigate to `localhost:8080/start` and `localhost:8080/admin/start` in your web browser after running the `npm run docs:dev` command.

Now let's test the example of the product price in which when a client accesses the product page, the web application should retrieve the client price and display it. Similarly, when an administrator accesses the same page, the web application should retrieve the administrator price instead.

To do so, add these lines to the code above:

```php{7,8,19,20}
// larammerce-project/routes/web.php/

Route::get("/start", function(){

    echo ("Hi, This is /start \n <br/>");

    $product = product::find(20);
    echo "The product price is:" . product->price . "\n <br/>";

    echo \App\Utils\CMS\AdminRequestService::isInAdminArea()?
    "We are in admin area" : "We are out of admin area";

});

Route::get("/admin/start ",function(){

    echo ("Hi, This is /admin/start \n <br/>");

    $product = product::find(20);
    echo "The product price is:" . product->price . "\n <br/>";

    echo \App\Utils\CMS\AdminRequestService::isInAdminArea()?
    "We are in admin area" : "We are out of admin area";

});

```

Now path to the `/app/Models/Product.php` and write the codes below in the file:

```php{4-7}
...
protected static string $TRANSLATION_EDIT_FORM = "admin.page.product.translate";

public function getPriceAttribute(){
   return AdminRequestService::isInAdminArea() ?
   "The admin price" :
   "The customer price";
}
```

Now if you set the URL to `localhost:8080/start`, the output would be:

```html
Hi, This is /start The product price is: The customer price We are out of admin
area
```

And if the URL is set to `localhost:8080/admin/start`, the output would be:

```html
Hi, This is admin/start The product price is: The admin price We are in admin
area
```

For further information let's have a quick review on request life sycle:

## Request lifecycle in Laravel

If the request passes through all of the matched route's assigned middleware, the route or controller method will be executed and the response returned by the route or controller method will be sent back through the route's chain of middleware.

**Note:** In general, the lifecycle of a request in laravel starts from the client-side and goes through some stages. For more details study _request lifecycle in laravel_ _<sup>[1](#1)</sup>_ and _middleware_ _<sup>[2](#2)</sup>_.

### Request lifecycle in Larammerce

In Larammerce, the first middleware layer identifies if an incoming request is for the admin panel or other parts of the platform by following a specific path. This helps the platform to determine the appropriate actions and generate correct responses.

Let's assume requests send to:

- `/any-URL` endpoint which is intended for the client-side.

and

- `/admin/any-URL` endpoint which is intended for the server-side (admin).

also suppose there is a `Product class` that has an accessor method.
Within this method, it can be specified that if the incoming request is from the admin side, the pure price of the product should be returned, but if the request is from the client side (based on the URL), then the discounted price should be returned instead.

To achieve this functionality, a middleware layer is utilized that analyzes the incoming request using a defined detector mechanism. If the authenticated user is in admin area, the middleware informs all relevant components of this fact so that they can generate the appropriate response.

:::tip Class Accessor
Accessor is a method or property that provides access to the private members of a class from outside the class.

### Admin request management functions

To better understand, let's check the functionality of some functions in `AdminRequestMiddleware.php` file.

On the Larammerce project, path to `larammerce/app/Http/Middleware/AdminRequestMiddleware.php` file.

```php
...

$user = get_user($guard);   // Retrieves the authenticated user.
$systemUser = $user -> systemUser;
//  Checks whether the retrieved user is a system user or not.
$action = Action::withRequest($request);
// The system takes action to determine what the system user's request is.

if (!$request->has("related_model"))
    $request->merge(["related_model" =>
    app($action->getClassName())?->getModel()]);
// The if statement dentifies the object that is being managed in the admin panel.
...

$this->setOrderAttributes($request);
// Detects the criterion on which sorting should be based.
$this->setLayoutAttributes($request);
// Detects the method for displaying the items, which can either be a list
// or a grid.
$this->setPaginationAttributes($request);
// Detects the current page of the admin panel that is being accessed.
...

ApplianceService::init();
/* Pertains to the appliances, which refer to every content on the toolbar
  or the sub-items of each page. This function manages the arrangement of
  the appliances and determines which ones should be enabled or disabled
  based on the administrator's role.
*/

```

In order to determine whether the request is in the admin erea or not, all of these functions need to incorporate a detection mechanism. This can be achieved by utilizing two functions, namely `setInAdminArea` and `isInAdminArea`, which are located within the `AdminRequestService.php` file. To access these functions, navigate to the following path: `Larammerce/app/Utils/CMS/AdminRequestService.php`.

```php{5}
// app/Utils/CMS/AdminRequestService.php

 private static string $ADMIN_AREA_KEY = 'in_admin_area';

 public static function setInAdminArea($request = null)
    {
        $searchResult = array_search('admin',
        explode("/",$request->server('REQUEST_URI')));
         //searches for the string 'admin'
        $result = ($searchResult !== false and $searchResult < 2);
        //This condition ensures that the function sets the in_admin_area
        //attribute to true only when the request is being made in the admin area.
        RequestService::setAttr(self::getAdminAreaKey(), $result, $request);
    }

// app/Utils/Common/RequestService.php

     public static function setAttr($key, $value, $request=null){
        $request = self::getRequest($request);
        $request->merge([$key => $value]);
    }
```

```php
public static function isInAdminArea($request = null)
    {
        return RequestService::getAttr(self::getAdminAreaKey(), $request);
    }
    // If the attribute exists and has a non-null value, then the function will return `true`, indicating that the current request is in the admin area

```
